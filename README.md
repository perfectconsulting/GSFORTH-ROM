# GSFORTH (Rom)
Generic Subroutine Thread FORTH for the BBC Micro
=================================================

This was my first large assembly program. I wrote it the summer of 1983 (at the age of 16)

The origional program is written in BBC BASIC using the build-in assembler. Because the source has to be in memory to assemble, this limits the maximum size of any assembly program built using BBC BASIC. As work around I split the code into modules each chain-loaded as overlays.

This new version is the modern re-work of that original code. My ambition all those years ago was to turn my forth into a rom image, sadlyI never achieved this at the time. My hope now, is that this project will achieve that goal.
